# ECE289-AVRinFPGA

This is an AVR architecture design with most of the neccesary intructions to run any Arduino program.
It also contains a UART bootloader, and fully featured debugger with step by step instructions, breakpoints and real-time register visualization.

This project is currently abandoned, but in its current state it should work on most Intel/Altera FPGAs.
